This application is for tracking physical fitness and discipline. It is a combination of our daily habits along with physical fitness metrics.

The idea is to focus on what is most important for health or what gives us the most bang for your buck. I am not a nutritionist or a personal trainer, I just consume a lot of gym bro youtube content and have come to these conclusions of what I should be accomplishing in 7 days (to be achieved on sepearate days each week).

In order of priority:
1. 6 Restful nights of sleep.
2. 2 Resistance Training Sessions
3. 7 Days of 8000+ steps or a cardio equivelent
4. 1 20 minute Sauna session (or two 10 minute sauna sessions)
5. 6 Cold Plunges
6. 2 minutes of all out sprinting
7. 90 minutes of zone 2 cardio
8. 6 meditation sessions
9. 1 Day Core training
10. 1 Day mobility training

We gain higher attributes mostly with fitness metrics. Discipline, we control based on what we do each day. Constitution can also be affected by what we do each day because some assumptions can be made, like if we got a good nights sleep for example.
